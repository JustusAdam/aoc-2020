# Advent of Code 2020

This is not a repository for congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, although I
respect her work very much, this is for the Advent of Code 2020.

I started late, but since I have now caught up to the latest problem I figured
I'd put my solutions out there as well.

Most of the solutions will probably be in Haskell.

So far all of these are stack scripts, so if you wish to run any of these you
can simply do `.src/DayN.hs input-file` provided you have
[stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org) installed.
